  <h1>APPEND</h1>
  <h2>key value</h2>

<h3>Available since 1.0.0. <br/>
Time complexity: O(1) The amortized time complexity is O(1) assuming the appended value is small and the already present value is of any size, since the dynamic string library used by Redis will double the free space available on every reallocation.</h3>

<p>Atomically sets key to value and returns the old value stored at key. Returns an error when key exists but does not hold a string value.</p>
